<!--
Welcome
The Azul GUI toolkit is a free, functional, IMGUI-oriented GUI framework for rapid prototyping of desktop applications written in Rust, supported by the Mozilla WebRender rendering engine.

This is the official documentation on how to use the Azul GUI toolkit. It will walk you through your first application, the concepts of Azul (state management, layout, tasks, deamons, dynamic CSS values, SVG drawing).

This documentation is merely "supplementary" so you can understand the concepts used by Azul and how to effectively use it.
